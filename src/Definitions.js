            Sexual health not only pertains to the individual's physical
            reproductive health, but to the individual’s understanding and
            implementation of healthy conduct in sexual interactions and
            relationships. WHO defines sexual health as “[...] a state of
            physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being in relation to
            sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction, or
            infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach
            to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of
            having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion,
            discrimination, and violence.” (WHO, 2002). Our research aims to
            determine whether a comprehensive understanding of sexual health is
            promoted and attainable through information available in public
            libraries.

            Sex Education or sexuality education is the organized dissemination
            of information pertaining to sexual health and sexual behavior.
            Comprehensive sex education is the evidence-informed dissemination
            of accurate and reputable information regarding matters including
            but not limited to "consent and healthy relationships; puberty and
            adolescent development; sexual and reproductive anatomy and
            physiology; gender identity and expression; sexual identity and
            orientation; interpersonal and sexual violence; contraception,
            pregnancy, and reproduction; and HIV and other STDs/STIs" (SIECUS,
            2020)

            Denotes legislation in American states which requires that sex
            education be taught in schools. This legislation also stipulates
            what will be taught and how it will be taught, with age-appropriate
            subject matter also stipulated. "State mandated sex education" does
            not denote a specific, uniform, national curriculum, only that these
            states require a form of sex education be taught to a specified
            extent at a specified point or points in public schools between
            grades K-12.

          <td>Pleasure-Based Sex Education</td>
          <td>
            "When comprehensive sex education is ‘pleasure based,’ it emphasizes
            that sexual activity should be pleasure-focused. It normalizes the
            idea of giving and receiving pleasure not just in sexual activity,
            but in relationships as a whole" (Planned Parenthood, 2018). For our
            purposes, pleasure-based sex education refers to the dissemination
            of information relating to best practices physically, emotionally,
            and mentally when engaging in sexual expression for pleasure. We
            specify this form of sex education to differentiate pleasure-based
            information from curricula and materials focused solely on the
            reproductive aspects of sexual expression.

            The census defines "rural" as "any population, housing, or territory
            NOT in an urban area" (Census, 2021). The Census also stipulates
            that "To qualify as an urban area, the territory identified [...]
            must encompass at least 2,500 people" (Census, 2021).
